 * `vpn` indicates the user is on a VPN (Virtual Private Network)

 * `web_proxy` indicates the user is on a web proxy server, which may allow them to conceal information such as their IP address or other identifying information.
 * 
 * `public_proxy` indicates the user is on a public web proxy server, which is similar to a web proxy but can be shared by multiple users. This may allow multiple users to appear as if they have the same IP address for instance.
