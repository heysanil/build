/**
 * The ACH networks used for the funds flow.
 * 
 * For requests submitted as either `ach` or `same-day-ach` the cutoff for same-day is 3:30 PM Eastern Time and the cutoff for next-day transfers is 5:30 PM Eastern Time. It is recommended to submit a request at least 15 minutes before the cutoff time in order to ensure that it will be processed before the cutoff. Any request that is indicated as `same-day-ach` and that misses the same-day cutoff, but is submitted in time for the next-day cutoff, will be sent over next-day rails and will not incur same-day charges.
